# 🐾 Creating a Zoo

A simple Java project that simulates a zoo using Object-Oriented Programming principles. This application was developed as part of the Amazon Junior Software Developer certification on Coursera.

## 🚀 Features

- Abstract base class `Animal` to define shared properties and behaviors
- Interfaces:
  - `Eat`: allows animals to eat
  - `Swim`: for swimming behavior
  - `Walk`: for walking behavior
- Concrete animal classes like:
  - `Tiger`, `Penguin`, `Dolphin`, each implementing different behaviors
- `Main.java` to demonstrate polymorphism in action
